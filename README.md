# ðŸŒ™ DreamJournal

A voice-first dream recording app designed to help users develop lucid dreaming abilities and explore consciousness through astral projection techniques.

## **Core Concept**

DreamJournal solves the critical problem of **fading dream memory**. When you wake up from a vivid dream, you have seconds before the details disappear. Our app provides instant voice recording to capture dreams naturally, then uses AI transcription to build a searchable dream database for pattern recognition and lucid dreaming development.

## **Current Features**

- **Voice Recording** - One-tap dream capture with luminescent UI
- **Sacred Interface** - Dark theme with glowing blues/purples to mirror dream states
- **Tab Navigation** - Clean organization (Sacred Space, Timeline, Insights)
- **Spiritual Design** - Breathing animations and consciousness-focused UX
- **Mock Transcription** - Development-ready with realistic dream scenarios

## **Tech Stack**

- **React Native 0.79.3** with Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **expo-audio** for voice recording and playback
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Spiritual Color Theme** - Dark backgrounds with luminescent accents

## **Speech-to-Text Integration**

The app currently uses mock transcription for development. To enable real speech-to-text:

### **Google Cloud Setup**
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Speech-to-Text API
3. Deploy cloud function (see `/cloud-function` directory)
4. Update `CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL` in `useVoiceRecording.ts`

### **Audio Format**
- **iOS**: `.wav` format (LINEAR16, 44100Hz, mono)
- **Android**: `.m4a` format (MPEG4/AAC, 44100Hz, stereo)
- **Web**: `.webm` format (Opus codec)

## **Design Philosophy**

### **Consciousness-Focused UX**
- **Dark backgrounds** create contemplative space
- **Luminescent accents** guide attention without distraction  
- **Breathing animations** sync with natural rhythms
- **Sacred geometry** in circular recording interface
- **Minimal interactions** for drowsy morning use

### **Color Psychology**
- **Deep Space Black** (#0F0F23) - Cosmic consciousness
- **Glowing Violet** (#8B5CF6) - Third eye activation
- **Electric Blue** (#3B82F6) - Astral plane connection
- **Cyan Glow** (#06B6D4) - Higher dimensional awareness

## **Lucid Dreaming Features**

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Automatic detection of common dream signs
- Personal dream symbol tracking
- Reality check suggestions based on content

### **Consciousness Development**
- Dream clarity scoring (1-10)

- Progress metrics for awareness development

### **Reality Check System**
- "Look at your hands - count fingers"
- "Read text twice - does it change?"
- "Check digital clocks for consistency"
- Custom suggestions based on dream patterns

## **Success Metrics**
